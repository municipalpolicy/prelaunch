# Considerations for Naming
1. Domain name availability
2. Uniqueness—Is the name or its acronym likely to be confused for another organisation?
3. NWP—Does a Wikipedia page exist for the acronym?
4. ADPFS—is there an alternative domain name available with the acronym?
5. Gravitas—Does it inspire confidence
6. Whimsy—Does it sound fun?
