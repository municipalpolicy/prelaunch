### Considerations for Naming
1. Domain name availability
2. Uniqueness—Is the name or its acronym likely to be confused for another organisation?
3. NWP—Does a Wikipedia page exist for the acronym?
4. ADPFS—is there an alternative domain name available with the acronym?
5. Gravitas—Does it inspire confidence
6. Whimsy—Does it sound fun?

## Positioning
### Competitive landscape
* Urban does long-range research
* WWC is data-driven reform oriented
* Cities of Service is volunteerism oriented
	* Blueprint contests are interesting though
* Living Cities
* Midwest democracy network look into 
* Mayor’s Innovation Project (Madison WI) Center on WI Strategies
	* focused new best practices for cities (all sizes)
	* evolved S/M cities
	* Satya Conway DJB
	* Pushing out ideas/best practices (info sharing network)
	* Struggled w/ TA
* Center for Neighbourhood Technology (Chicago, IL) Scott Bernstein
	* opportunities for cities
	* real time arrival bus ridership
	* affordability matrix (transport/housing cost matrix)
		* drive until you qualify

### What can we add?
1. Scaled Policies
	1. 500k+ cities are not the only communities worthy of implementation assistance
2. Practical implementation assistance
	1. Academic and best practices research are useful, but city officials need  detailed guides to policy implementation
3. Global perspectives
	1. The US is not the only or primary source of best practices
	2. South-North learning
4. Desiloed competencies vs sectoral conversations
	1. A lot to learn from different fields and professional communities
	2. Tie in scale differences (int dev, national, state, local), sectoral communities (policy/advocacy per issue)
5. Longer term engagement —> Iterated models

* scaling down for "impact"
* We believe municipalities and local governments…
	* … are the front-line implementors of policy initiatives; there is no impact without healthy cities and effective city governments
	* …are the least partisan political forum, as their outputs and outcomes are sufficiently concrete that the public can evaluate them directly
	* …are under-resourced given their role
	* …are diverse in their size, role, and capabilities, but share with each other proximity to the public both in political oversight and policy impact
	* …are a natural opportunity for South-North-South learning
	* …are critical and  policy support and capacity enhancement
